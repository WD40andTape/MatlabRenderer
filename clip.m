function [ vertices, connectivity, ids ] = clip( vertices, connectivity )
%CLIP Clip faces/edges/vertices in the clip space of the graphics pipeline.
% 
% Implements clipping for vertices, edges/lines (with the Cohen-Sutherland 
% algorithm), and triangular faces/meshes (with the Sutherland-Hodgman 
% algorithm) in the clip space of the rendering pipeline. The clip space 
% occurs after the projection matrix is applied, but before the perspective 
% divide (normalization).
%
% SYNTAX
%   [ vertices, connectivity, id ] = clip( vertices )
%   [ vertices, connectivity, id ] = clip( vertices, connectivity )
%
% INPUTS
%   vertices      Nx4 array, where each row represents the homogenous
%                  coordinates (X,Y,Z,W) of a vertex in 4D clip space. We 
%                  use the convention that the clip space is defined by 
%                  -W≤X≤W, -W≤Y≤W, -W≤Z≤W. The alternative convention 
%                  defines 0≤Z≤W.
%   connectivity  (OPTIONAL) Mx1, Mx2 or Mx3 array where each row indexes 
%                  the vertices of a vertex, edge, or face primitive, 
%                  respectively. Faces need to be defined with a clockwise 
%                  winding. Default: Mx1 array defining unlinked vertices.
% OUTPUTS
%   vertices      Same definition as input. Vertices may be added or 
%                  removed during clipping.
%   connectivity  Same definition and order as input. Primitives completely 
%                  outside of the viewing frustum are removed. If the 
%                  primitives are triangles, then the output may contain 
%                  additional new triangles created in the process.
%   ids           Integer column vector which references the row indices of 
%                  the input connectivity array. The IDs of deleted 
%                  primitives will be removed. The IDs of new triangles 
%                  created by splitting existing triangles will share the 
%                  original ID.
