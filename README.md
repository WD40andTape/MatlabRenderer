Implementation of the computer graphics pipeline for triangulated meshes, in addition to a number of camera plotting functions.

A notable use case is to simulate RGB or Kinect (depth) camera images for computer vision applications.

The codebase is compact, extensively documented, and uses only MATLAB built-in functions.

## Functions and Classes

| Name | Description
| -- | -- |
| `world2image` | Project world points, edges, and faces into image space. |
| `rasterize` | Rasterize projected mesh to form an image composed of pixels. |
| `raycast` | Compute ray direction from the camera to pixels. |
| `clip` | Clip faces, edges, vertices in the clip space of the graphics pipeline. Used by `world2image`. |
| `edgefcn` | Test whether 2D points are within triangular faces. Used by `rasterize`. |
| `Camera` | Object for plotting a camera and storing its properties.<ul><li>*Properties*</li><ul><li>`projectionMatrix` : 4-by-4 projection matrix.</li><li>`imageSize` : Camera resolution, `[width height]`.</li><li>`t` : Camera translation, `[x y z]`.</li><li>`R` : 3-by-3 camera rotation matrix.</li><li>`plotHandles` : Graphics handles.</li></ul><li>*Methods*</li><ul><li>`Constructor` : Set and validate Camera properties.</li><li>`plotcamera` : Plot a mesh representing the camera.</li><li>`plotframe` : Plot the camera's Cartesian coordinate system.</li><li>`plotfov` : Plot a mesh representing the camera's field-of-view.</li><li>`setview` : Set the MATLAB axes' view to match the Camera object.</li></ul></ul> |
| `ProjectionMatrix` | Build, store, and modify a camera projection matrix.<ul><li>*Value* : 4-by-4 projection matrix.</li><li>*Methods*</li><ul><li>`Constructor` : Build a camera projection matrix, either with the camera's field-of-view and aspect ratio, by defining the frustum coordinates directly, or by converting from a camera intrinsic matrix.</li><li>`decompose` : Extract properties of the camera's view frustum.</li></ul></ul> |

## Notes

- The toolbox was designed to have only minimal internal dependencies. Therefore `Camera`, `clip`, `edgefcn`, etc. can largely be used independently of the rest of the toolbox. The toolbox's individual functions and classes could be useful for *different* rendering pipelines, for example, to rasterize 2D vector graphics, or beyond the computer graphics pipeline, for example, to simply plot the location of a camera within a scene.

- As the renderer runs on the CPU and uses only MATLAB code, its speed is limited. On a standard laptop, for a scene with 8000 faces and at a resolution of 300x300, I get around 12 fps. Nevertheless, for applications which don't need a high speed, having everything within MATLAB is handy.

- Does not currently implement interpolated face colors (from colored vertices) or lighting.

- If the user has a camera intrinsic matrix, rather than a projection matrix, e.g., when simulating a camera calibrated in MATLAB, the ProjectionMatrix class can be used to convert this to the necessary format.
